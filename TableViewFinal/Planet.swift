    //Add four properties to the Planet class: name, numberOfMoons, fullOrbit, and facts. name should obviously be a String, and numberOfMoons should be an Int.
    //fullOrbit is the length of the planet's orbits in days. Can you guess what data type this should be? A planet's orbit can be a fraction of an Earth day, so this should be a Double.
